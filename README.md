# BlackJack Simulator

## ü§ñ Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This project was made for the class "Programming I" at Florida Gulf Coast University.

My partner and I built a fully functional blacjack simulator that allows users to play head to head versus a dealer in their terminal.

Note: I expanded on this project and built a user interface, check out "Blackjack_SFML" in my github.
